        document.getElementById('79-series').innerHTML='The 80 series Land Cruiser, produced from 1990 to 1997, is renowned for its exceptional off-road capability and durability, often considered one of the best 4x4s ever made. It was the first Land Cruiser to feature coil-spring suspension, providing a smoother ride while maintaining its legendary toughness. The 80 series also introduced full-time four-wheel drive with a locking center differential and low-range transfer case. Some models even included optional front and rear locking differentials. ';
